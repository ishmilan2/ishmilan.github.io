### Communication

* These diagrams shows the Docker images needed to set the application service in his first version (**_App:1.0_**). The version number will be increasing during the system evolution.
* The user access from his **_web browser_** to the **_host_** is through the port **_80_**. The communication between the host and the **_Docker container_** can be established using any port.

### Data Volumes
Both diagrams use one data volume, but for different targets.

* **_Development environment:_** uses the **_volume_** to store all the **_source code_**. Doing this, the developers can make the necessary adjustments and see the changes easily.
* **_Production environment:_** uses the **_volume_** only to store configuration files because all the **_source code_** is copied inside the **_Docker_** image during his build. The configuration files are references to the web server **_Nginx_**.

### Database
The database used for this example was **_SQLite_**. This database is configuring automatically during the project creation. The database is part of the **_data volume_** in the **_production environment_** in order to realize backups frequently.
